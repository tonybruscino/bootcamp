## General
Most of the stuff you will learn is going to be from doing tasks and researching. Don't be afraid of google it's your best friend.

## Bash, Unix and the Command Line
You will pick up a lot of bash and unix knowledge doing various projects but I recommend learning the basics of moving around. Since you are studying the [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) you can reference the [appendix](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) for basic commands.

## Python
Learn Python the Hard Way is a good place to start but will only give you the basics.

## Simple Projects
I've included a few minimal projects below. Most of these are well solved problems and a lot of information on doing this can be found online with some some googling. Do not be afraid to use the resources that you can find online to complete these. Any of the assets that you have while doing this project should be stored in a git repository.

### Setup a Virtual Lab
Learning how to work with virtual environments is very important to working locally from your own computer. All future projects will be completed within virtual machines so understanding this process is fundamental to progressing.

#### Goals
Set up a virtual machine on your laptop running ubuntu 16.04.

#### Hints
- Look into virtualization tools like virtualbox.
- Don't be afraid to google how to complete this exact task. Their might be videos or articles to help you along.

#### Bonus Points
- Research vagrant. How can this tool be used alongside your code?

### Setup a webserver
Setting up a webserver is a common task for anyone working in development or systems. This task will expose you to a wide range of basic system adminstration skills.

#### Goals
Set up a either nginx or apache webserver in your virtual machine from the previous step and configure it to respond with "Hello World" when you browse to that site in you web browser.

#### Hints
- Don't be afraid to google how to do this. There are plenty of resources. If you do google this, spend the time to understand what each step is doing.
- Ask questions if you don't understand.

#### Bonus Points
- Style your page. Make that "hello world" look as interesting as possible.

### Replace the site on this webserver into a blog.
There are many additional tools out there that help convert static sites, like the one from your previous task into a dynamic site. Setting up a blog will expose you to using a database to store content and working with scripting languages.

#### Goals
Replace your old install with a [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) blog installation.

#### Hints
- [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) has a great 5 minute install guide.
